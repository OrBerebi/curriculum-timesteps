# curriculum-timesteps
This project proposes integrating a noise-aware dynamic sampling mechanism. By adapting timesteps amount during training based on sample-specific reconstruction errors, the model optimizes its learning process, improving reconstruction quality and reducing metrics such as the Frechet Inception Distance (FID).
